All screens consistently use:\n\n- **Same header pattern** with back button, title, and optional action buttons\n- **Consistent back navigation** using `router.back()` from expo-router\n- **Proper TouchableOpacity implementation** with the arrow-back-outline icon\n- **Correct color contrast** using `colors.text` for the back button icon\n\nThe back navigation pattern is implemented correctly in all screens including:\n- Hot Work Operations (newly added)\n- Fire Safety, Chemical Safety, Electrical Safety\n- Fall Protection, Lifeline Safety, Scaffolding Standards\n- Excavations, Confined Space, PPE Standards\n- Emergency Response, Environmental Compliance\n- Equipment Database, Add Equipment\n- Lifting Calculator, Lifting Resources, Risk Assessment\n\nThe app now has a complete set of HSE resources with proper navigation functionality.
